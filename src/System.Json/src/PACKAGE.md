## About

<!-- A description of the package and where one can find more documentation -->

Provides standards-based support for the serialization of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

The System.Json namespace was designed for Silverlight, which is no longer supported. For processing JSON, we recommend using APIs in the System.Text.Json namespace instead.
